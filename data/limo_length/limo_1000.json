        "output": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about six apple trees where the number of apples on each tree forms an arithmetic sequence. The highest number of apples is double the lowest, and the total number of apples is 990. I need to find the greatest number of apples on any of the six trees. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. So if the number of apples on the trees is in an arithmetic sequence, then each tree has a number of apples that is the previous one plus some common difference, right?\n\nLet me denote the number of apples on the six trees. Let's say the first term (the least number of apples) is a, and the common difference is d. Then the numbers of apples on the six trees would be: a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d, a + 5d. Since there are six trees, the sixth term would be the greatest number of apples, which is a + 5d. \n\nThe problem states that the greatest number is double the least number. So that means a + 5d = 2a. Let me write that down:\n\na + 5d = 2a\n\nIf I subtract a from both sides, that gives:\n\n5d = a\n\nSo, a = 5d. That relates the first term and the common difference. Got that.\n\nAlso, the total number of apples is 990. The total of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated by the formula:\n\nTotal = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term)\n\nIn this case, the number of terms is 6, the first term is a, and the last term is a + 5d. Plugging that into the formula:\n\nTotal = (6/2) * (a + (a + 5d)) = 3 * (2a + 5d)\n\nWe know the total is 990, so:\n\n3 * (2a + 5d) = 990\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n2a + 5d = 330\n\nBut from earlier, we found that a = 5d. So we can substitute a with 5d in this equation. Let's do that:\n\n2*(5d) + 5d = 330\n\nCalculate 2*5d = 10d, so:\n\n10d + 5d = 330\n\n15d = 330\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\nd = 330 / 15\n\nLet me compute that. 15 times 20 is 300, so 330 - 300 is 30, so 20 + 2 = 22. So d = 22.\n\nNow, since a = 5d, substituting d = 22:\n\na = 5*22 = 110\n\nSo the first term, the least number of apples, is 110. The common difference is 22. Therefore, the number of apples on the six trees are:\n\n1st tree: 110\n\n2nd tree: 110 + 22 = 132\n\n3rd tree: 132 + 22 = 154\n\n4th tree: 154 + 22 = 176\n\n5th tree: 176 + 22 = 198\n\n6th tree: 198 + 22 = 220\n\nLet me check if the greatest number is double the least. The least is 110, double that is 220. The greatest is 220, so that checks out.\n\nNow, let's verify the total. Adding up all these numbers:\n\n110 + 132 = 242\n\n242 + 154 = 396\n\n396 + 176 = 572\n\n572 + 198 = 770\n\n770 + 220 = 990\n\nPerfect, that's exactly the total given. So everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of apples growing on any of the six trees is 220.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any assumptions. Let me think again. The problem says \"the numbers of apples... form an arithmetic sequence\". So it's an arithmetic sequence with six terms, where the maximum term is twice the minimum term, and the sum is 990. We set up the terms correctly as a, a + d, ..., a +5d, which is six terms. Then we used the given conditions to form equations and solved for a and d, leading us to the answer 220. The steps make sense, and the verification shows the numbers add up correctly. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{220}",
